Given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of word that starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of ch (inclusive). If the character ch does not exist in word, do nothing.

For example, if word = "abcdefd" and ch = "d", then you should reverse the segment that starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive). The resulting string will be "dcbaefd".
Return the resulting string.

 

Example 1:

Input: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"
Output: "dcbaefd"
Explanation: The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3. 
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "dcbaefd".

class Solution {
    public String reversePrefix(String word, char ch) {
        int in=word.indexOf(ch);
        StringBuilder sb=new StringBuilder();
        if(in==-1)
        {
            return word;
        }
        else if (in!=-1)
        {
            for(int i=in;i>=0;i--)
            {
                sb.append(word.charAt(i));
            }
            sb.append(word.substring(in+1));
        }
    return sb.toString();
    }
}
