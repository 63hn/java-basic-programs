You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

 

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r

class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
        int m=word1.length();
        int n=word2.length();
        StringBuilder sb=new StringBuilder();
        int i=0;
        int j=0;
        while(i<m || j<n)
        {
            if(i<m)
            {
                sb.append(word1.charAt(i++));
            }
            if(j<n)
            {
                sb.append(word2.charAt(j++));
            }
        }
    return sb.toString();
    }
}
